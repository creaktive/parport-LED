LED Device Controller by Stas
        (Mail: stas@linuxbr.com.br; URL: http://sysd.hypermart.net)

	This is a user-friendly program to test and debug
simple Parallel Port robots. Interface is
self-explanatory (I hope). Program supports multiple
Parallel Ports (up to 4), whitch are auto-detected
and can be switched on-fly. Program starts using
first availble port from LPT1. If your robot is
connected to LPT2 for example, and you don't want
to switch port all times you use LED Device
Controller, you can do following:
	1). Enter in DOS Shell
	2). Type these lines, where "*" if LPT
	    number (1 for LPT1, 2 for LPT2, up
	    to LPT4):
DEBUG LED.COM
E 129 *
W
Q
	3). Just run LED.COM again!
